very evening at sunset, thirteen-year-old Mira walked to the old wooden bridge near the Rushikulya river on the outskirts of Berhampur, Odisha. The bridge, worn by monsoon rains and decades of use, connected two sleepy villages. Most locals avoided it now, calling it weak and unsafe. But for Mira, it was a quiet refuge—her own private corner away from the noise of markets and traffic near Annapurna Market.

One evening, as she sat on the railing watching the sky turn orange and gold, she heard a gentle creak behind her. Turning around, she saw an elderly man leaning on a wooden walking stick. His face looked familiar, like someone she had seen in old photographs at the community library.

He smiled kindly and asked, “Why do you come here alone, child?”

Mira replied softly, “Because the bridge listens. It feels peaceful… like it understands.”

The man chuckled. “Many years ago, I helped build this bridge,” he said. “Back then, people crossed it every day. It wasn’t just a bridge—it was a lifeline between families.”

Surprised, Mira asked, “Why did people stop using it?”

The old man looked at the flowing Rushikulya. “People forget the value of simple things. They chase new roads and bigger paths.”

Before she could ask more, he walked toward the village, fading into the dimming light. The next morning, villagers found him at his home—he had passed away peacefully in his sleep.

Mira returned to the bridge, now feeling a deeper bond. She promised herself she would keep visiting, to honour his memory and the bridge that held so many forgotten stories.
